            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Healthier Kids Foundation (HKF) is a non-profit health agency based in San Jose, CA,
                that provides children, their parents and care takers medical services and screenings
                 as well as educational programs.
                <br><br>

                According to HKF's saleforce data there's thousands of mothers and children who 
                received help with the organization and over 3,400 children who were successfully 
                enrolled in subsidized medical insurance plans since 2016.


                ​
                However, the inconsistent design and poorly structured content of their
                website are resulting in unfavorable user experience. With the growing social
                need for its services and increasing competitive pressure in the nonprofit industry,
                HKF needs an urgent visual overhaul of their website to grow its reach and impact.

        <div class="twoParagraphs">

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h6>Primary research</h6>
                <p>According to recent census report on Santa Clara County 
                only 41% of the population have English as first language. 
                The majority (57.6%) speak language other than English at home.
                To make this site accessible to more people we decided to add multilingual support.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h6>Competitive analysis</h6>
                <p>We conducted a competitor analysis to see what other organizations are doing well and what they aren’t to help us 
                    For the purpose of this presentation, we will talk about 2 of our main direct competitors. 
                    
                    MV: 
                    From our Direct Competitor Gardner has: 
                    +Select language options that filled up the gap between language barriers
                    -Gardner has a great use of negative space, but their choices of icons were a bit confusing like the about icon, the mission icon? What is that? 
                    -there is a proper use of color scheme going, but it’s a bit too low quality.  
                    </p>

                <h6>Heuristic evaluation</h6>
                <p>The Ideation phase of the project began with an in-depth Heuristic Evaluation and annotations. In addition to the key user insights from the previous phases, we also learned that:
                    The logo does not comply with the basic Gestalt Principles of UI
                    The color palette was complex and it did not pass the color testing completely
                    Visual inconsistencies with photography and elements throughout the website</p>

                <p>The goal of conducting in-person interviews with 8 
                    participants helped us further empathize with users 
                    and identify their main pain points. Participants were 
                    asked to perform a set of tasks on the website and their 
                    interaction with the system was observed to gather insights.<br><br>

    <h2>Identifying user needs</h2>

    <p>We gathered all the data from interviews and usability tests and organization the information into themes. After several rounds of synthesis, we were able to create an affinity diagram synthesizing the data into key themes as shown. The key insights for the team were: 
        Users liked the platform for inexpensive healthcare alternatives for children considering the expensive Bay Area.
        The majority of the users were parents from low-income households whose first language was not English. 
        Users felt confused navigating through the website content.
        Users found the website bold but inconsistent overall.
        Users did not like that the organizational structure (Mission, personnel, etc.) 
        was unclear and that there were a lot of third-party links.</p><br><br><br>

<!--Style tile-->
<div id="caseSection">
   
        <h2>Design system</h2>
        <p>I wanted to create a color palette that is associated with kids and provokes positive emotions. 
            There are 2 things that were important - website should look gender neutral, and colors must be bright and 
            modern but nod standard 'medical' pallette. <br><br>
            In order to make the site look more friendly and soft I chose buttons with round corners. For the same 
            reason I used google font "cabin" as it has rounded letters. It looks playful and still has high readability.
            <br><br>
            Another challenge of visual redesign was making a new logo. Initially it wasn't planed, 
            however during our first round of interviews respondents mentioned that they like the 
            concept of the current logo and that made us pay more attention to it. Interviewees 
            specifically liked the use of multiple colors and the mood it conveys, when people 
            look at the logo it represents happy children and we definitely wanted to keep that aspect. 
            However, I found a couple of issues with existing logo that motivated me to redesign it. 
            First of all it is very complicated and hardly responsive. When it’s small it’s not easy 
            to differentiate 3 people and see details. Next, it exists in 1 variant - horizontal 
            positioning where text is on the side. That makes it even less responsive and hard to 
            use for the vertical layouts. And the last part - it resembles a restroom sign which is hard to unsee once noticed.
            <br>
            So taken all that to account I made a new logo. It's simple and bright, responsive and can be used for different
            purposes and it has soft round lines.
