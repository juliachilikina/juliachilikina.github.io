        <div class="aboutProject">
        <p> Healthier Kids foundation (HKF) is a family forward health agency that gives children and 
            those who love them the education and tools

            The organization’s website is dated and does not provide the best user experience

            The purpose of this redesign project is to improve user flow, 
            build more intuitive information architecture, develop

            <h2>Overview</h2><br>
            <p>
            The goal of this three week long project was to redesign a non-profit organization's site. 
            Our small design team, consisted of Pooja Bhangay and me, wanted to use this opportunity to help 
            and we chose an organization with a huge impact - Healthier Kids Foundation.
            It is a non-profit health agency based in San Jose, CA, that provides children, their parents 
            and care takers medical services and screenings as well as educational programs and 
            integrates healthy lifestyles into home environments. <br><br>

            According to HKF's Salesforce data there's thousands of mothers and children who 
            received help with the organization and over 3,400 children who were successfully 
            enrolled in subsidized medical insurance plans since 2016.<br><br>
   ​
            However, the inconsistent design, poorly structured content, cluttered interface and 
            unclear information architecture of HKF website are resulting in unpleasant and inefficient 
            user experience. With the constant social need for its services Healthier Kids Foundation 
            needs a visual overhaul of their website to grow its reach and impact.

                <p>We started with pulling the population data and statistics for San Jose, California.
                    According to the most recent census report (2019) on Santa Clara County 
                <b>only 41%</b> of the population have English as first language. 
                The majority (57.6%) speak language other than English at home.
                So, in order to make this site accessible to more people we have to add 
                multilingual support.

                    of the current site. We interviewed parents, teachers, and caregivers from 
                    the Bay Area and observed their interaction with the system 
                    while they were performing the same set of tasks - find the mission of the 
                    organization, find the vision screening program, and make a donation.    ​

<!--Style tile-->
<div id="caseSection">
   
        <h6>Design system</h6>
        <p>In parallel with defining, ideating and prototyping phases we were building project style tile.
            Our goal was to create a color palette that is associated with kids and provokes positive emotions. 
            We wanted the new page to look gender neutral, soft, friendly and modern and at the same time 
            avoid standard medical colors such as blue or green. So, we ended up with a pastel palette 
            with bright accents.<br><br>
            To maintain the soft look all the UI elements, such as buttons, have rounded corners and smooth
            lines. For the same reason we used font family "Cabin" as it has elegant rounded letters and has high readability.  
        </p>
            <img id="persona" class="shadow" src="../images/hkf/style_tile.png">
            <p id="caption" class="padding80">No visual impairment</p>

        <p>One of the main goals of the project was to make the new version of HKF website more accessible,
        so we tested our style tile for two common color blindness conditions, Protanopia and Tritanopia. 
        Although color palette looks different from the original one, the elements still look contrasted 
        and it's easy to differentiate primary action from the secondary, as well as donate button stands out.</p>
         <div class="twoImages" id="padding100">
            <div class="caption">
                <img id="gifLeft" class="shadow" src="../images/hkf/tritanopia.png">
                <p id="caption">Tritanopia vision</p>
            </div>

            <div class="caption">
                <img  id="gif" class="shadow" src="../images/hkf/protanopia.png">
                <p id="caption">Protanopia vision</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Another challenge of visual redesign was making a new logo. Initially it wasn't planned. 
            However, during our first round of interviews respondents mentioned that they like the 
            concept of the current logo and that made us pay more attention to it. Interviewees 
            specifically liked the use of multiple colors and the mood it conveys, when people 
            look at the logo it represents happy children and we definitely wanted to keep that aspect. 
            However, I found a couple of issues with existing logo that motivated me to redesign it. 
            First of all, it is very complicated and hardly responsive. When it’s small it’s not easy 
            to differentiate 3 people and see details. Next, it exists in 1 variant - horizontal 
            positioning with text on the side. That makes it even less responsive and hard to 
            use for the vertical layouts. And lastly - it resembles a restroom sign which is hard to unsee once noticed.
            <br><br>
            So, taken all that into account I created a new HKF logo. It's recognizable, more balanced, simple and 
            responsive and can be used in many layouts.
        </p>

    <h6 id="wideParagraph">Desktop homescreen</h6>
        <p>We brought organization's value proposition to the homepage to avoid confusion about HKF specific. 
            It's followed by the list of three most popular health programs and then by secondary information. 
            Donate button grabs attention right away. And we incorporated language menu, so that user can immediately 
            change language.
            We used 12 column grid to make the new HKF website responsive and optimized for laptop, tablet and mobile. </p><br><br><br>

<!--Conclusion-->

    <div id="caseSection">
        <h6>Future steps</h6><br>
        <p> By the end of this project we were able to 
            deliver a redesign proposal with the intent to 
            present it to the management at the Healthier Kids 
            Foundation as per our communication. The key data 
            shared by the CEO in our Ideation phase helped us 
            validate our claims and strongly hold onto research 
            while we navigated through the redesign process.<br><br>
 
           
            
            Here are some fun directions for the website 
            design that we plan to undertake in the future.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>A Sign-up option to access the online health portal and files of the child that will 
                have information about appointments, reports, etc.</p></li>
            <li><p>Live instant messaging chat option with a nurse.</p></li>
            <li><p>Live-video chat with a doctor with real time language translation subtitles.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br><br> 
            <p>We have also created merchandise prototypes with new logo that can help generate extra funding opportunities 
            for the non-profit organization.
