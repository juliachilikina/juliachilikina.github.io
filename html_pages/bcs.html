        <div class="aboutProject">
        <p> Bootcampspot is an educational space for UC Berkeley Extension 
            students and faculty. Students access this site to check-in to 
            class, submit homework, check grades, view upcoming events and check their peogress.

            Being bootcampers ourselves we'd been using BCS for 6 months and knew its weaknesses.
            So for our final project, we decided to redesign bootcampspot. 
            <br><br>We wanted to create a platform 
            that is focused on the user experience. With all of the useful info on BCS, we want it to 
            be the tool that students use for more than just checking in 
            and submitting homework.

    <h2>Identifying user needs</h2>

    <p>We gathered all the data from interviews and usability tests and organization the information into themes. After several rounds of synthesis, we were able to create an affinity diagram synthesizing the data into key themes as shown. The key insights for the team were: 
        Users liked the platform for inexpensive healthcare alternatives for children considering the expensive Bay Area.
        The majority of the users were parents from low-income households whose first language was not English. 
        Users felt confused navigating through the website content.
        Users found the website bold but inconsistent overall.
        Users did not like that the organizational structure (Mission, personnel, etc.) 
        was unclear and that there were a lot of third-party links.</p>
