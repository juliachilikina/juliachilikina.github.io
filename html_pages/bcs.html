        <div class="aboutProject">
        <p> Bootcampspot is an educational space for UC Berkeley Extension 
            students and faculty. Students access this site to check-in to 
            class, submit homework, check grades, view upcoming workshops and check their peogress.

            We are a team of three designers and being bootcampers ourselves we'd been using BCS for 
            6 months and know its weaknesses.
            We found it ironic that a UX course has a website that clearly demonstrates lack of design. 
            So for our final project, we decided to redesign bootcampspot. 
            <br><br>We wanted to create a platform that is focused on the user experience. 
            With all of the useful info on BCS, we want it to be the tool that students 
            use for more than just checking in and submitting homework.

        <h2>Design system</h2>
        <p> The design system consists of the fonts, colors, interface elements, and 
            sample imagery that communicate the essence of our visual brand. 
            We wanted to create a platform that invites user to stay and explore.
            
            
            We use a super family font Poppins for 2 main reasons:
            Itâ€™s a geometric sans-serif that has big round characters and good spacing. 
            Its big lower letters relative to the uppercase keeps the font from being 
            boring and what is more important gives high readability.
            And, we wanted to use a Google font because it works well on almost all platforms.
            
            UI elements and components include primary and secondary 
            buttons, toggles, cards and a set of icons I created.

        <h2>Hi-Fi prototype</h2>
        <p>This section marks the beginning of 
            UI deliverables. It's the most exciting part of the 
            design process. It's also the most comprehensive and 
            crucial project stage as it involves designing detailed 
            mockups of the website, designing the logo, choosing an 
            appropriate color scheme and typeface and eventually 
            setting up a style guide that describes the usage of 
            each type of design elements used in the website and 
            also speaks a few words about the brand, Montero.

        <h2>Coding ðŸ¤“</h2>
        <p> I applied some coding to achieve what our dashboard page would 
            look like. I intentionally didnâ€™t use Bootstrap or Codepen (or any other open source) and built a fully 
            responsive page using oldschool HTML and CSS in 2 days!
            </p>

        <div class="gif" id="padding100">
            <img id="center" src="../images/bcs/coding.gif" alt="">
        </div>


        <div class="twoImages" id="noTop">
            <div class="caption">
                <h6 id="wideParagraph">Step 1</h6>
                <img id="gifLeft" class="shadow" src="../images/bcs/code-1.png">
                <p id="caption">First stage - defining the sections & divs. Looks as 
                    ugly as possible but really helps to see the structure of the future dashboard.
                    It took me about 5 hours to build the core structure in HTML.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="caption">
                <h6 id="wideParagraph">Step 2</h6>
                <img  id="gif" class="shadow" src="../images/bcs/code-2.png">
                <p id="caption">Thatâ€™s what it looked like after applying some CSS (+4 hours). Almost good.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h6 id="wideParagraph">Step 3</h6>
        <p class="padding40">And that's the coded version (1 day).  
            It looks exactly like the Hi-Fi prototype and it's fully responsive.<br><br>

            At landskape tablet orientation the layout updates. To keep the main 
            focus on the upcoming events, I moved the calendar bellow the fold. 
            Now the calendar takes the full width and shows month view.
            
            In the vertical orientation on a tablet both side navigation and top navigation goes to burger.<br><br>
            
            In the mobile version the calendar is back to the weekly view that is optimized for the smaller screens. 
            I removed the stats from the homescreen, since theyâ€™re always accessible on student's progress page. 
            I did it to be sure that check-in button, the most used during the course, is always above the fold. 
            So even when a student is running late itâ€™s easy to check in with a mobile.<br><br>
            
            And all of this is powered by real code!
