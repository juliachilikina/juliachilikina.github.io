        <div class="aboutProject">
        <p> Bootcamp spot is an educational space for UC Berkeley Extension 
            students and faculty. Students access this site to check-in to 
            class, submit homework, check grades, view upcoming workshops and check their progress.
            <br><br>
            We worked as a team of three designers and being bootcampers ourselves we've been using BCS for 
            6 months and know the experience from top to bottom.
            We found it ironic that a UX design bootcamp has a website that clearly requires some UX improvements. 
            Therefore, for our final project, we decided to redesign Bootcamp spot in order to provide future 
            students better experience and increase their satisfaction with the course.

            <h2>Overview</h2><br>
            <p>We wanted to create a platform that is focused on the users needs. 
                With all of the useful info on BCS, we want it to be the tool that students 
                use for more than just checking-in and submitting homework.<br><br>
                The current layout of the website is not optimized for the 
                tasks that are performed most frequently by the students. We want to address this problem 
                by redesigning the structure and layout of Bootcamp spot.
                Creating better information hierarchy, user flow and visual design 
                will increase students satisfaction with using the platform.</p>

                <h6>Heuristic evaluation & UI annotations</h6>
                <p>Evaluating the current layout and UI design was helpful in understanding what 
                    areas of the platform need improvement. Also we were able to identify the impediments
                    in the user flow that are preventing users from completing their tasks.

                    The main problems that were found are the following: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Unclear information hierarchy</p></li>

                        <li><p>Repetitive information and empty sections</p></li>
                        <li><p>No differentiation between primary and secondary call-to-actions</p></li>

                <h6>Survey</h6>
                <p> We shared survey with past and current bootcamp 
                    students to collect information and data points about consumers' needs. 
                    This graph shows what features are used 
                    the most on the platform. Only <b>4%</b> use Bootcamp spot to 
                    explore career services, while the main goal for the majority of students is career-related. 
                    So how can we improve user traffic in this area?<br><br>
                    Another interesting discovery is that 58% of students <b>never</b> use mobile phone
                    to access BCS, while only 7% use their phone often and 0% replied 'always'. When we 
                    were brainstorming, we thought that an app would be important for BCS site, however 
                    our quantitative data made us stay focused on the responsive desktop version.

    <p class="padding80"> In order to gather more data we interviewed 3 non-BCS students as part of competitive analysis.
        The research was focused on getting additional data on user experience with other university tools. We were able to get info from the respondents 
        about what works well, what they'd like to change, their wishes, needs, and how they evaluate overall interaction flow. All of this helps to understand 
        how we can improve BCS site. 

        All 3 users emphasized visual simplicity and easy navigation of non BCS tools in the research.

        <h2>Lo-Fi prototypes</h2><br>
        <p>We took what worked well from the paper prototypes and 
            implemented into the Lo-Fi prototype. We spent the most amount of time at the Lo-Fi stage and 
            had multiple iterations and 11 user testings to be sure that we deliver the smoothest user flow 
            at the end product.
            At usability testing we were interested in 3 workflows:
            <ul class="padding40">
                <li><p>checking-in to class</p></li>
                <li><p>submitting homework</p></li>

        <h6 id="wideParagraph">Lo-Fi prototype V.1</h6>
        <p> In our first lo-fi prototype we created the dashboard without navigation bar. We assumed that 
            users can navigate through the site with side buttons on the cards (1). The majority of users got 
            confused and didn't understand that these were clickable areas.
            <br><br>
            Then we asked to submit overdue homework (that was in 'my assignments') and some thought that statistics area (2) is clickable, 
            which we did not intend.
            <br><br>
            Finally, a half of testers said that top menu (3) is functional but cluttered and is lost on the page.

        <h6 id="wideParagraph">Lo-Fi prototype V.2</h6>
        <p>We took user feedback into account and improved the Lo-Fi prototype by 
            bringing back a side navigation (1), making stats area clickable (2), and minimizing secondary nav on the top (3).

        <h6>Design system</h6>
        <p> In parallel we were building our style tile. It consists of the fonts, colors, interface elements, and 
            sample imagery (we customized illustrations by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/khairitdinov" download target="_blank"> <u>@khairitdinov</u></a>) that communicate the essence of our visual brand. 
            We wanted to create a platform that invites user to stay and explore, so we use calm dark blue as a primary color and balance it with bright accents and negative space.
            
            
            We use a super family Google font Poppins that has high readablity.
            Itâ€™s a geometric sans-serif that has big round characters and good spacing. 
            Its big lower letters relative to the uppercase keeps the font from being 
            boring.
            
            UI elements and components include primary and secondary 
            buttons, toggles, cards, calendar and a set of icons that we created.

            <p> To be sure that we can move on with the chosen options we conducted a color blindness test to see 
                if our design decisions support accessibility needs. 
                The examples below show how people with 4 different types of visual impairment would see our style tile.
                Yes, it looks very different from the original one, but

<section id="noPadding" class="colorBG">

        <h2>Hi-Fi prototype</h2><br>
        <p>Here are the major changes that we made:<br>
            <ul class="padding40">
                <li><p>First of all we reduced amount of questions in the survey. Based on our research among bootcamp students and 
                    our own experience we kept questions that are more important.</p></li>
                <li><p>Dashboard cards now show next class, next assignment and next workshop. We used accent colors throughout the website to help user categorize them.</p></li>
                <li><p>Next class card allows student to quickly check in, request remote attendance and get access to session materials.  
                    Next assignment card has prominent 'submit' button.</p></li>
                <li><p>When students register to the next workshop it will right away appear in their personalized calendar on the right. 
                    This calendar will only show events that a person is registered to or that are required. We don't want to overwhelm user with 
                    unnecessary information. However, calendar can be expanded to a full weekly or monthly view to see all upcoming events and filter them.</p></li>
                <li><p>Lastly, we added a progress page. We wanted to create a place where a student can get all the necessary information 
                    about progress and current state in their course.</p></li>
            </ul>
    </p><br>

<!--Code-->
<section class="colorBG">
    <div id="caseSection">
        <h2>Coding ðŸ¤“</h2><br>
        <p> I applied some coding to achieve what our dashboard page would 
            look like. I intentionally didnâ€™t use Bootstrap or Codepen (or any other open source) and built a fully 
            responsive page using old-school HTML and CSS.
            </p>

        <div class="gif" id="padding100">
            <img id="center" src="../images/bcs/coding.gif" alt="">
        </div>


        <div class="twoImages" id="noTop">
            <div class="caption">
                <h6 id="wideParagraph">Step 1</h6>
                <img id="gifLeft" class="shadow" src="../images/bcs/code-1.png">
                <p id="caption">First stage - defining the sections & divs. Looks quite ugly but really helps to see the structure of the future dashboard.
                    It took me about 5 hours to build the core structure in HTML.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="caption">
                <h6 id="wideParagraph">Step 2</h6>
                <img  id="gif" class="shadow" src="../images/bcs/code-2.png">
                <p id="caption">Thatâ€™s what it looked like after applying some CSS (+4 hours). Almost good.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h6 id="wideParagraph" class="marginTop">Step 3</h6>
        <p class="padding40">And that's the coded version (+1 day).  
            It looks exactly like the Hi-Fi prototype and it's fully responsive.<br><br>

            At landscape tablet orientation the layout updates. To keep the main 
            focus on the upcoming events, I moved the calendar bellow the fold. 
            Now the calendar takes the full width and shows monthly view.
            
            In the vertical orientation on a tablet both side navigation and top navigation goes to burger.<br><br>
            
            In the mobile version the calendar is back to the weekly view that is optimized for the smaller screens. 
            I removed the stats from the home screen, since theyâ€™re always accessible on student's progress page. 
            I did it to be sure that check-in button, the most used during the course, is always above the fold. 
            So even when a student is running late itâ€™s easy to check-in with a mobile.<br><br>
            
            And all of this is powered by real code!
            </p>
